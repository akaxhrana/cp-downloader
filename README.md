Fast code with Codeforces on your IDE.

To make this work for you, use **incrontab** and _watch_ the Downloads folder.

- Use incrontab to move the downloaded file into the preferred directory.

```
/home/<user_name>/Downloads   IN_CREATE       mv /home/<user_name>/Downloads/*-codeforces.cpp /home/<user_name>/codeforces/

```

Feel free to get your hands dirty.

## About Incron

Incron is similar to cron, but instead of running commands based on time, it can trigger commands when file or directory events occur (e.g. a file modification, changes of permissions, etc.).
